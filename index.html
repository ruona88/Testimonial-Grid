                 I received a job offer mid-course and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. 
                 I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

                 " I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people
                 who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free into course and found it incredibly fun! I enroled shortly 
                 thereafter. The next 12 weeks were the best - and most gruelling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've 
                 successfully switched careers, working as a software engineer at a VR Startup. "

                 Awesome teaching support from the TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.. Getting guidiance from them and learning from
                  their experiences was easy.

                "Before joining the bootcamp, I had never written a line of code. I needed s structure prom professionals who can help 
                me learn programming stop by step.  I was encouraged to enrol by a former student of theirs who can say only 
                wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were vey hands on and I 
                never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It ook my learning 
                to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. Infact, I have often referred to it during my interviews 
                as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving 
                multiple offers. 100% recommended."

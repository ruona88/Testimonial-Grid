         Awesome teaching support from the TAs who did the bootcamp themselves.. Getting guidiance from them and learning from
          their experiences was easy.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        The staff seemed genuinely concerned about my progress which I find relly refreshing. The program gave me the confidence
         neccessary to be able to go our in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above 
         the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people.

         Such a life changing expeience. Highly recommended!

    <blockquote>
        Before joining the bootcamp, I had never written a line of code. I needed s structure prom professionals who can help 
        me learn programming stop by step.  I was encouraged to enrol by a former student of theirs who can say only 
        wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were vey hands on and I 
        never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It ook my learning 
        to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. Infact, I have often referred to it during my interviews 
        as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving 
        multiple offers. 100% recommended.
